# CFG-Implementation
## Simulate a Context-Free Grammar (CFG)

• Set of Terminals

• Set of non-Terminals

• Production Rules

• Start Symbol

You must simulate a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) by implementing the

following components and ensuring correct behavior during derivation:


• Terminals: The set of symbols that appear in the final strings of the language.

• Non-Terminals: The set of symbols used to represent variables in the grammar.

• Production Rules: A mapping from a non-terminal to one or more strings
(which may include terminals and/or non-terminals).

• Start Symbol: The non-terminal symbol from which derivation begins.

For each problem, pass the CFG configuration (Terminals, non-Terminals,
Production Rules, Start Symbol) to your simulation class (or function) and
Ensure it correctly processes input strings.

# CFG
1. Write a CFG for accepting strings with equal number of a's and b's.
2. Write a CFG for accepting strings where the number of b's is
twice the number of a's.
3. Write a CFG for accepting strings that is not a palindrome Σ = {a,b}.
4. Write a CFG for accepting a language {a
2n+3 b
n
| n>=0}.

5. Write a CFG for accepting a language {a

n b m | n>m and m>=0}.

## Notes
• All previous CFG’s accept empty string except 3 and 5.

• CFG rule’s will be hardcoded in your program.
